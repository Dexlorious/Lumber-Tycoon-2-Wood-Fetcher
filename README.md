# Lumber-Tycoon-2-Wood-Fetcher (GUI Version)
After making the chat version, I learned and have made a GUI version with easier usage, more features, and better methods.

## Tree Settings
	Tree Size
You can choose to get the biggest or smallest tree (WORK IN PROGRESS)
##
	Tree Position
You can choose to get the closest or farthest tree
##
	Doesn't Matter
You don't care and it chooses the biggest, closest, or farthest tree

## Teleport Methods
	CFrame
The same idea as tween, except uses CFrame (Current method to bring the trees back)
##
	Tween
Tweens to the tree's position
##
	Kill
Kills your character and teleports them when they respawn (Axes Will Not Drop)
